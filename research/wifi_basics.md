## Wifi Basics
-----

### Wireless Signals

Wireless signals are **electromagnetic waves** travelling through the air - formed by electric energy travelling through a piece of metal.

**Frequencies of standard signals**: 

1. AM Radio: 10MHz
2. FM Radio: 100Mhz
3. Television: Many frequencies from 470MHz to 800MHz, and others.
4. Cellular phones: 850MHz, 1900MHz, and others
5. Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz
6. Satellite: 3.5GHz
7. Wi-Fi: 5GHz

Certain devices can only listen to certain types of modulations and frequencies E.g. satellites could not ommunicate with your every day laptop

### Recievers and Transmitters

Transmitter:
- Sends information to other devices through signals
  
Reciever:
- Picks up transmitted signals and *understands* the information

Transciever:
- Has both a reciever and a transmitter


## Wifi Signals

**2.4GHz** (14 Channels): 
- Lower frequency
- Used by many devices today
- Signals can become crowded and *interference* can occur 
  
**5.0GHz** (~165 Channels): 
- Higher frequency
- Used by fewer devices
- Can achieve higher speeds because signals are less crowded
- Cannot pass through walls and windows as well as 2.4GHz (range is often shorter)
